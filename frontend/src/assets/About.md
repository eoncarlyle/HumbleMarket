Schmitt's Humblemarket is a project by Iain Schmitt.
This is a fake money prediction market, similar to Manifold Markets.
Humblermarket users can buy and sell positions that a given outcome will or won't take place by the time a market closes.
When an outcome market closes, correct positions redeem for one credit per share , while incorrect positions redeem for zero credits per share.
Features are still being added to the application, as of December 2023 only admin users can create markets but user created markets will be added soon.
Bugs and issues can be reported to market@iainschmitt.com.
