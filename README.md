**README**

The production application is hosted at [humblemarket.iainschmitt.com](https://humblemarket.iainschmitt.com/). Don't hesitate to contact me at [market@iainschmitt.com](mailto:market@iainschmitt.com) or report a bug on this repository to report any issues.

**Development Concerns**

- Running the fronted locally just requires Vite

  - `npm run prod-backend` uses the backend served at `api.humblemarket.iainschmitt.com` and serves the frontend on `localhost`

- Running the backed locally requires JDK >= 17 and MongoDB daemon `mongod` >= 5.0.23
