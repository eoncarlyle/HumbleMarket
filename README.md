**README**

- Running the fronted locally just requires Vite, I believe
  - `npm run prod-backend` uses the backend served at `api.humblemarket.iainschmitt.com` and serves the frontend on `localhost` 

- Running the backed locally requires >= JDK17, MongoDB >= 5 - I don't think there are any other backend dependencies
